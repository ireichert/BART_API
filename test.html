        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>About me! I am a petite ballerina dancing in beautiful California. I have big dreams, and I look forward to
            sharing my journey through my blog. I'm a big animal lover, and recently became a "foster fail" by adopting
            Hermeownee and Draco Meowfoy.</p>

        <h2>Kitten Life</h2>
        <p>I recently discovered what it was like to foster not one but two kittens. They were shoved in a mailbox of a
            shelter and had no one to take care of them in the shelter so I agreed to foster them. But of course life
            with two kittens is not as easy as it looks in movies so tag along on their adventures.</p>

        <h1>Blog</h1>
        <p>You can imagine being a ballerina is makeup and fancy costumes every day but for this ballerina it's a little
            more. I share my adventures of being a brand ambassador to life as a ballet student during covid. Of course
            I also share in my trips to events and my occasional disney indulgences, I do love my dole whips.</p>
